# Exploration of MobileNetV3 Architecture and it's Robustness:
#### Yassin Bahid

After the success of the first and second iterations pg MobileNet, A.Howard moved to try and find the optimal MobileNet Architechture. This change signals a shift from feature engineering to architechture engineering. We shall explore this architechture and it's components, before shifting to testing it's robustness.
